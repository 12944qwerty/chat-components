# Chat Components
A replugged plugin that adds useful chat tooltips and components into chat
This is very much WIP so bear with me

## Color Component
 - Allows you to see the color different colors are in chat and switch between hex, rgb, and hsl.
 - Very buggy and needs to be improved upon soontm
 - Inspired by the [bd version](https://github.com/Puv1s/ColorTooltips)
